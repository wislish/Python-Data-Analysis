# Game Data Mining


### Project Goal

This project is to build important features, layer by layer, that could be helpful to game data analysis. Additionally, it builds a simple machine learning model to try to predict and explain the user retention rate as well as the user payment rate. 


### Code

I have written all the code in this repository alone.

### Explanation 

1. Each layer is mainly focus on one aspect of the game, such as ui, play mode and key index. 
2. Pandas is not adopted to manipulate the data because the data is too large to fit in the local machine memory. Instead, we are streaming the data from the database and processing the data without storing them in the memory.
3. Build tools.py to improve the reusability and maintainability.
